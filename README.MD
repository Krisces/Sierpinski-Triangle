## Setup and Installation

#### Installation

Make sure to install the latest version of Python. While installing, add Python to PATH. <br/>
Then, download EzGraphics.

#### Don't forget to install it! In my case, I downloaded and then installed the GZ file "ezgraphics-2.2.tar.gz

```bash
    pip install Downloads/ezgraphics-2.2.tar.gz
```

## Running The App

I recommend installing Visual Studio Code as well, and then running triangledraw.py.

#### This should work as well:

```bash
    python triangledraw.py
```

It will ask you what background color and color of the triangle you want. Then you need to specifiy the density of the triangle. <br/>
After that, another window should pop up and show you the triangtle you specified
